			<p>All participants are subject to the Code of Conduct signed upon registration to the hackathon.</p>
			<p>HackCooper is a community hackathon intended for collaboration and learning in the student community. We value the participation of each member of the student community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the hackathon. To make clear what is expected, all attendees and speakers at this hackathon are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
			<p>We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment. All HackCooper participants agree to:</p>
			<p>Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.</p>
			<p>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it. Be careful and mindful of the words that you choose. Remember that exclusionary comments and hacks can be offensive to those around you. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
			<p>Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Staff (including volunteers and sponsor representatives) should not use sexualized clothing/ uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
			<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, HackCooper may take any action HackCooper deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please report the incident to HackCooper staff.</p>
